<h5>Review</h5>
<p>
Ikigai urges individuals to simplify their lives by pursuing what sparks joy for them ― Marie 'KonMari' Kondo

I love [this] book… I read it and it’s bewitched me ever since. I’m spellbound

A refreshingly simple recipe for happiness... According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai. It means your purpose – the reason you get up in the morning. The thing that fires you up and keeps you busy. Your raison d'être. ― Stylist

Curl up on the sofa with this and enjoy an insight into Japanese culture while picking up some self-care tips you may not have considered before... Ikigai offers an insight into a gentle yet focused way of life built around a sense of purpose. ― Independent

Ikigai gently unlocks simple secrets we can all use to live long, meaningful, happy lives. Science-based studies weave beautifully into honest, straight-talking conversation you won’t be able to put down. Warm, patient, and kind, this book pulls you gently along your own journey rather than pushing you from behind.

[The] Japanese art of ikigai ... Its basic message is about "authentic living". Practitioners must fill in overlapping circles that cover motivation, fulfilment, what they earn and what improves their life. The answer at the centre will be the key to a happy and long life. ― Guardian

If hygge is the art of doing nothing, ikigai is the art of doing something - and doing it with supreme focus and joy. ― New York Post
